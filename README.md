# JA2-Character-Animation-Photobooth
Blender framework meant for creating new animations to JA2
Extract make_script.7z and JA2 2.9_033.blend.7z to the project folder for needed files and programs.

Animating, rigging and setting up a prop is done inside Blender. 
Rendering is done through the commandline via batchscripts and a python script given to blender along with the .blend file.

Folder 'batchScriptData' contains files with data used by the rendering script and programs that convert the rendered output to .sti files that Jagged Alliance understands.

See this tutorial for an introduction to the rendering setup.
