Todo:
- work on camo pants and sleeves
- Now that adding and rendering props is a lot more convenient. Different armor would be nice


Missing animations:
- riot shield needs its own set of animations (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)
- Throw grenade when in water (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)


Known issues:
- Death animations lack blood spurts/head explosion
- LAW animations lack smoke and fire effects
- Mortar animation lacks smoke and fire effects
- Karate punch uses the same RGMPUNCH animation surface as the regular punch. Bio's skilltrait filters are not implemented so we can't differentiate between karate and regular punch
- Badass merc sidestep with rifle not working yet. Needs a proper filter
- Same for badass merc sidestep with pistol


Reported bugs:
- Female crouch walking animation with drawn weapon is a bit weird - you'll notice when you see it
