Missing animations:
Merc in water
mortar anims
helidrop
badass merc anims
riot shield


Known issues:
Death animations lack blood spurts/head explosion
Dark pixel artifacts in SCARH sprites in certain camera angles
Same for TRG42 and wooden stock sniper rifles
Could probably do the same for M14 sprites to emulate semiauto rifles with polymer stocks
Helmet could be better
Karate punch uses the same RGMPUNCH animation surface as the regular punch. Bio's skilltrait filters are not implemented so we can't differentiate between karate and regular punch
