Todo:
- work on camo pants and sleeves
- red berette color needs to be toned down a bit
- Create better animation lists so the need to comment/uncomment lines is minimized
- Increase rendering sample size to get rid of render artifacts (Do only just before making the final final renders)
- Now that adding and rendering props is a lot more convenient. Different armor would be nice


Missing animations:
- Merc in water
- mortar anims
- bigmale throw rock idle anim
- riot shield needs its own set of animations (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)
- Throw item/grenade when in water (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)


Known issues:
- Death animations lack blood spurts/head explosion
- LAW animations lack smoke and fire effects
- Karate punch uses the same RGMPUNCH animation surface as the regular punch. Bio's skilltrait filters are not implemented so we can't differentiate between karate and regular punch
- Badass merc sidestep with rifle not working yet. Needs a proper filter
- Same for badass merc sidestep with pistol


Reported bugs:
- Female crouch walking animation with drawn weapon is a bit weird - you'll notice when you see it
