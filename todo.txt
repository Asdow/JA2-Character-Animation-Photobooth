Todo:
work on camo pants and sleeves


Missing animations:
- Merc in water
- mortar anims
- helidrop
- riot shield needs its own set of animations (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)


Known issues:
- Death animations lack blood spurts/head explosion
- LAW animations lack smoke and fire effects
- Karate punch uses the same RGMPUNCH animation surface as the regular punch. Bio's skilltrait filters are not implemented so we can't differentiate between karate and regular punch
- Badass merc sidestep with rifle not working yet. Needs a proper filter
- Same for badass merc sidestep with pistol
