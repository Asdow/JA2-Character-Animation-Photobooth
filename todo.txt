Missing animations:
Merc in water
mortar anims
helidrop
female merc anims
riot shield needs its own set of animations (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)


Known issues:
Death animations lack blood spurts/head explosion
LAW animations lack smoke and fire effects
Paletteswap for M14 sprites to emulate semiauto rifles with polymer stocks
Same for TRG42 and wooden stock sniper rifles
Karate punch uses the same RGMPUNCH animation surface as the regular punch. Bio's skilltrait filters are not implemented so we can't differentiate between karate and regular punch
Prone crawling animation has pixelated legs when behind backpack, again
Badass merc sidestep with rifle not working yet. Needs a proper filter
Same for badass merc sidestep with pistol
