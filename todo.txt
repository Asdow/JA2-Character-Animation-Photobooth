Todo:
- Redo TRG42 green material and sprites, it doesn't look particularly good right now
- Tweak camopattern materials to look better ingame
- Damnit, we need an uzi model
- Muzzleflashes need to be rerendered so they're not black and white


Missing animations:
- Merc in water
- mortar anims
- helidrop
- female merc anims
- riot shield needs its own set of animations (Needs codework for nonLOBOT bodies)


Known issues:
- Death animations lack blood spurts/head explosion
- LAW animations lack smoke and fire effects
- Karate punch uses the same RGMPUNCH animation surface as the regular punch. Bio's skilltrait filters are not implemented so we can't differentiate between karate and regular punch
- Prone crawling animation has pixelated legs when behind backpack, again
- Badass merc sidestep with rifle not working yet. Needs a proper filter
- Same for badass merc sidestep with pistol
